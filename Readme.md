# Mustafa & Daddy hacking lessons ...

Hello Big Boy King, this is Daddy writing to you. This web site will be the place to share with you all what I know about hacking so you can one day stop the hackers. 

## Let's start ...

First say Hi to Gopher, he is our friend who will be with us in learning GOLANG.

Wait a minute, what is GOLANG? GOLANG is short for GO Programming Language. It is how people write instructions for the computer to run, people such as hackers and us who want to stop them. 



## First: install the tools we need

The tools we need are: 
1. **GOLANG compiler** (psst: compiler is kind of program that translates the commands we write into computer language)
2. **Code Editor**, this is a program that you use to write the program you want to run, such as the infinte loop 

### Installing GOLANG

First we click on **Activities** then we select the square with four dots like below

Then we open __snap store__ like so

Once the snap store open, you should see something like the following

When the installation finishs, you will see a screen like the below. Click on the __back__ button , be carefull not to click on remove btton otherwise Gopher will go away :)

now we are done with installing __GOLANG__, to verify that the installation was ok open your terminal and type 
```
go help

```

you should see somehting like that

so far so good, Now for the next step which is installing the text editor 

### Installing Code Editor ( Visual Studio Code )

Remember __snap-store__, it is like candy store to us, it has all the goodies we need. Go back to snap store and search for __Visual Studio Code__ like so

<img src="images/vscode.png">

click on it and click the __install__ button same as you did with __GOLANG__

<img src="images/vs-code-1.png">

After it finishes, you should find an icon for Visual Studio Code when you open your application like so

Click on it to open it and you shall see this screen
